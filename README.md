# tksvg for Python's Tkinter
[tksvg](https://github.com/oehhar/tksvg) is a package for Tcl/Tk that
adds support for SVG image files. Tkinter makes use of Tcl/Tk under the
hood, and thus can benefit from this addition. Note that SVG support 
has been included in Tk 8.7 and thus this package can be made obsolete 
in the future when Python gets distributed with Tk 8.7.
